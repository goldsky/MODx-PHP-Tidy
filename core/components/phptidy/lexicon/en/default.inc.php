// HTML, XHTML, XML Options Reference
$_lang['prop_add-xml-decl_desc'] = 'This option specifies if Tidy should add the XML declaration when outputting XML or XHTML. Note that if the input already includes an &lt;?xml ... ?&gt; declaration then this option will be ignored. If the encoding for the output is different from &quot;ascii&quot;, one of the utf encodings or &quot;raw&quot;, the declaration is always added as required by the XML standard.';
$_lang['prop_add-xml-space_desc'] = 'This option specifies if Tidy should add xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot; to elements such as &lt;PRE&gt;, &lt;STYLE&gt; and &lt;SCRIPT&gt; when generating XML. This is needed if the whitespace in such elements is to be parsed appropriately without having access to the DTD.';
$_lang['prop_alt-text_desc'] = 'This option specifies the default &quot;alt=&quot; text Tidy uses for &lt;IMG&gt; attributes. This feature is dangerous as it suppresses further accessibility warnings. You are responsible for making your documents accessible to people who can not see the images! ';
$_lang['prop_anchor-as-name_desc'] = 'This option controls the deletion or addition of the name attribute in elements where it can serve as anchor. If set to &quot;yes&quot;, a name attribute, if not already existing, is added along an existing id attribute if the DTD allows it. If set to &quot;no&quot;, any existing name attribute is removed if an id attribute exists or has been added.';
$_lang['prop_assume-xml-procins_desc'] = 'This option specifies if Tidy should change the parsing of processing instructions to require ?&gt; as the terminator rather than &gt;. This option is automatically set if the input is in XML.';
$_lang['prop_bare_desc'] = 'This option specifies if Tidy should strip Microsoft specific HTML from Word 2000 documents, and output spaces rather than non-breaking spaces where they exist in the input.';
$_lang['prop_clean_desc'] = 'This option specifies if Tidy should strip out surplus presentational tags and attributes replacing them by style rules and structural markup as appropriate. It works well on the HTML saved by Microsoft Office products.';

$_lang['prop_decorate-inferred-ul_desc'] = 'This option specifies if Tidy should decorate inferred UL elements with some CSS markup to avoid indentation to the right.';
$_lang['prop_doctype_desc'] = 'This option specifies the DOCTYPE declaration generated by Tidy. If set to &quot;omit&quot; the output won&#39;t contain a DOCTYPE declaration. If set to &quot;auto&quot; (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based upon the contents of the document. If set to &quot;strict&quot;, Tidy will set the DOCTYPE to the strict DTD. If set to &quot;loose&quot;, the DOCTYPE is set to the loose (transitional) DTD. Alternatively, you can supply a string for the formal public identifier (FPI).<br /><br />&#10;&#10;For example:&#10;doctype: &quot;-//ACME//DTD HTML 3.14159//EN&quot;&#10;&#10;<br /><br />If you specify the FPI for an XHTML document, Tidy will set the system identifier to an empty string. For an HTML document, Tidy adds a system identifier only if one was already present in order to preserve the processing mode of some browsers. Tidy leaves the DOCTYPE for generic XML documents unchanged. <span style="color:#A52A2A;">--doctype omit</span> implies <span style="color:#A52A2A;">--numeric-entities yes</span>. This option does not offer a validation of the document conformance.';

This option specifies if Tidy should merge nested &lt;div&gt; such as &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;. If set to &quot;auto&quot;, the attributes of the inner &lt;div&gt; are moved to the outer one. As well, nested &lt;div&gt; with ID attributes are not merged.

Note you can&#39;t change the content model for elements such as &lt;TABLE&gt;, &lt;UL&gt;, &lt;OL&gt; and &lt;DL&gt;. This option is ignored in XML mode.';
$_lang['prop_new-empty-tags_desc'] = 'This option specifies new empty inline tags. This option takes a space or comma separated list of tag names.

This option causes Tidy to set the DOCTYPE and default namespace as appropriate to XHTML. If a DOCTYPE or namespace is given they will checked for consistency with the content of the document. In the case of an inconsistency, the corrected values will appear in the output.

For ascii, Tidy will accept Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) character values, but will use entities for all characters whose value &gt; 127. For raw, Tidy will output values above 127 without translating them into entities. For latin1, characters above 255 will be written as entities. For utf8, Tidy assumes that both input and output is encoded as UTF-8. You can use iso2022 for files encoded using the ISO-2022 family of encodings e.g. ISO-2022-JP. For mac and win1252, Tidy will accept vendor specific character values, but will use entities for all characters whose value &gt; 127.

A BOM is always written for XML/XHTML output using UTF-16 output encodings.';
$_lang['prop_output-encoding_desc'] = 'This option specifies the character encoding Tidy uses for the output. See char-encoding for more info. May only be different from input-encoding for Latin encodings (ascii, latin0, latin1, mac, win1252, ibm858).';
